# Foreign Exchange Currencies Calculator

I developed a Django app that anyone could use. FX (forex), the LARGEST financial market in the world trades every single day more than 5 trillions $ !

User should complete this form with the below values

1. Entry Price
2. Target Price
3. Stop Loss
4. Lot Size

and the calculator will extract the expecting **Profit** and the **Loss**.

*Good Luck to everyone.*
